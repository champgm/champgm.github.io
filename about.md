I have been professionally developing software since 2013, when I worked with a 30-person team to standardize and store medical records in a reference database. We used Java 6 when Java 8 was cool, we stepped all over each other's toes in the same git repository, and we wrote a batch MapReduce job that was edging towards taking longer than 24 hours, when I left.

Since then, I've grown comfortable with the skills I've developed while working for various other companies and done my best to use them to make my own life easier.
